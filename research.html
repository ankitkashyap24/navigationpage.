<h1>1) One million Earths could fit inside the Sun â€“ and the Sun is considered an average-size star.</h1>


<h1>2) For years it was believed that Earth was the only planet in our solar system with liquid water. More recently,
     NASA revealed its strongest evidence yet that there is intermittent running water on Mars, too!</h1>
<h1>3)A Stellar Lifespan

    Stars have a lifecycle, with larger stars burning out faster than smaller ones. Our sun, a medium-sized star, has an estimated lifespan of about 10 billion years.
    
    </h1><h1>4)The Pillars of Creation

    The Eagle Nebula's Pillars of Creation, a star-forming region, is located about 6,500 light-years from Earth.</h1>
    
    <h1>5) The Sun's Energy

        The Sun releases an astonishing amount of energy, equivalent to about 600 million tons of nuclear explosions every second.
